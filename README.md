# Case-type-oriented evaluation metrics

This repository contains the official code for paper "On Imbalance in Case Types: Evaluating and Enhancing PLMs for Criminal Court View Generation"

Case-type-oriented evaluation metrics include Case-type-oriented Text Generation (CTG) and Case-type-oriented Imbalance Performance (CIP).

## CTG

CTG mitigate the unfair assessment among different case types by assigning equal weight to each type.

## CIP

CIP evaluates performance imbalance by measuring the distance between the performance of each case type and the overall performance.


Our code will be open-sourced here upon the acceptance of the manuscript.
